**Before day of recording:**

1.        Half-media change 1d before recording (assure >1mL of conditioned media is available per well of 12-well plate to avoid evaporation during recording)

**Day of recording:**

1.        Remove media per well and replace with fresh maturation media containing 1uM Cal-520 (500uL per well of 12-well plate). Store conditioned media in falcon tube. Incubate organoid plate @ 37C 5%CO2 for 1-1.5hrs.

2.        Remove Cal-520 media slowly with a P1000 and perform 1-2 washes with fresh maturation media

3.        Gently remove media and replace with 1mL conditioned media per well (unless otherwise stated - e.g., for hypoosmolarity stimulation)

4.        Incubate organoid plate @ 37C 5%CO2 until ready for recording.
